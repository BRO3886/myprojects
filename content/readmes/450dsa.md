# 450dsa
DSA Solutions synced to GitHub using [LeetHub](https://sidv.dev/gh/leethub)

## Sid, why are you doing DSA????
Practicing DSA on GFG and LeetCode primarily because of uni requirements. Anyhow, it's fun to solve a question or two when you're bored with dev.

## What is this LeetHub thingy and what do you mean by sync?
I found a really cool extension a couple of weeks ago, called [LeetHub](https://github.com/QasimWani/LeetHub/), but it only supported syncing problems and solutions from LeetCode. Here in India, there's another really good website for DSA stuff: [GeeksForGeeks](https://geeksforgeeks.org), so I just modified that extension to include GeeksForGeeks submissions.

You can download [My fork](https://sidv.dev/gh/leethub) of the extension, especially if you're in college and preparing for placements, and want a repo which auto syncs submissions so that you can refer the problem and your solution code whenever you need to.
